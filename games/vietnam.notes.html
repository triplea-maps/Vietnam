== Vietnam == <br> by Tim Brennan and Mike Iadarola; adapted to TripleA by adoY<br><br>After the defeat of the Japanese in the Pacific, America had to formulate a policy for Asia and the rest of the world. As allies of Ho Chi Minh's fighters against the Japanese, it is clear that the U.S. had several choices in Indochina. The decision to back the French, attempting to regain control of the region, led to America's eventual involvement, and all the consequences thereof. The war that ended in 1973 had led to all of the following: 57,661 U.S. Servicemen Dead, over 2 Million Vietnamese Dead, the first military defeat for the U.S., internal turmoil in the U.S., distrust of the government and military, the devestation of much of Vietnem, and many other things. Is it possible the war could have turned out differently? It is up to you to decide... <br><br>Axis: Vietnam, China, Russia<br>Allies: USA, United Nations <br><br>Special Rules:<br><br>USA starts the game with long-range aircraft and heavy bombers. <br><br>Chinese and Soviet units may not occupy the same territory together.<br><br>United Nations cannot produce units in Europe and only can build units in Australia. If Russia attacks Europe or a neutral nation the UN can begin production in Europe.<br><br>Russia and China cannot build or receive income until they join with the Vietnamese. See below. (to do this, just reset the Chinese/Russian PU value using edit mode.)<br><br>Vietnam rolls one die at the end of each turn (not round). If a 1 is rolled then Russia or China joins Vietnam and this nation can begin to produce units and receive income. Which country joins the war is up to the UN. (Note: I haven't figured out how to do this rule for online games yet. For now, just use a real die.)<br><br>Every Chinese turn one Vietnamese infantry appears in China. It is controlled by Vietnam (this can be done by using edit mode). Chinese units cannot enter Vietnam until China enters the war. Vietnamese units can however enter China.<br><br>Due to anti-war movements in the United States the following will happen: On the 5th turn the United States surrenders 3 PU's to the bank. On the 6th turn the United States surrenders 6 PU's to the bank. On the 7th turn the United States surrenders 10 PU's to the bank. (this can be done by using edit mode.)<br><br>New unit: Helicopters<br>The allied forces have the ability to build helicopters. Helicopters cost 10 PU's and attack at 3 or less while defending at 3 or less.<br><br>Victory Conditions:<br>Axis: Hold Indochina for 7 rounds.<br>Allies: Within 7 rounds liberate Indochina (capture it).<br><br>Enjoy! ~ adoY
